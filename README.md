Node.js: slowcook
=================

`slowcook` is a module I made because I was getting sick of how intrusive most boiler plate modules are.

[![npm Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fs-extra.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/slowcook)

Why?
----

It's like a boilerplate, but its a slowcooker. Get it?


Installation
------------

    npm install slowcook -g

Usage
-----

Open your terminal or powershell and run the follow command:

```bash
slowcook -n "projectname"
```

For verbose output type the following:

```bash
slowcook -n "projectname" -v
```
